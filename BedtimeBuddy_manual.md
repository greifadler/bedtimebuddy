Bedtime Buddy User Manual 

Introducing Bedtime Buddy, the last alarm clock you will ever need. We at Bedtime Buddy do not just provide you with an alarm clock, but focus on a rather holistic approach giving you insight into your own sleep quality. We do this by a noise counter which can be interpreted as the REM sleep phase. Furthermore, we provide you with your individualized sleeping times and statistics for you to detect problems and determine the perfect sleep schedule. Bedtime Buddy also features an option for you to get up with the sunset.
