## Introduction

Welcome to **Bedtime Buddy**, the ultimate alarm clock solution. Rather than being just another alarm clock, Bedtime Buddy offers a holistic approach, providing insights into your sleep quality. We achieve this with the help of a noise counter, which can be indicative of the REM sleep phase. Not only that, but you'll also receive personalized sleep times and statistics, enabling you to identify any issues and optimize your sleep schedule. And for those who love to rise with the sun, we've got an option just for you!
